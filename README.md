# AdLayer Protocol

A user-first, crypto-powered ad monetization layer for the modern web.

AdLayer gives power back to users by letting them:
- Watch ads and get paid
- Skip ads by paying micro-fees
- Request free access through community sponsorship

## 🌐 How It Works
AdLayer is a browser extension + website SDK combo. It overlays onto webpages and allows users to choose how they engage with monetization. AI customizes ads, crypto handles the flow of value.

## 🔧 Tech Stack (planned)
- Web: JS overlay / extension (Firefox, Brave first)
- Backend: Node.js + lightweight API
- Payments: Solana or L2 Ethereum
- Wallets: MetaMask, Phantom, or embedded wallet

## 📃 Whitepaper
See `whitepaper.md` for the full concept breakdown.
